# QgenY
A UVM Environment and testbench generator

##Problems addressed in current flow
1. Update in interface leads to changes in multiple files and tests
2. Difficult to keep records or versions for diffrent projects
3. Usually Directed tests are developed which are developed which are difficult to randomize
4. Needs additional efforts to manage bugs
5. Different developer styles affect the uniformity
6. Difficult to understand by new developer
7. Add difficulties during code review
8. No good way of commenting the code
9. Not much portable hence reduced reusability
10. Consumes lot of time in TB developement and fixing rather than focussing on actual debug

##Problems with current generators
1. All of them need to be used for complete development of TB
2. Need to use their propritery tools
3. Needs to purchase license
4. Lot of time spent in integrating with Qualcomm flow
5. Dedicated support required to solve issues
6. Most of them are unaware of real problems faced by engineers
7. Not easy to automate
8. Difficult to use at block level directly
9. Though support autocomplete and templates which again adds overhead to existing code as well as style
10. Doesn't support bug reporting and debugging at simulation level
